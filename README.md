# mad-libs-project-phase-1
For this project, we made a mad-libs game for the user to play. Once the Page is open, all the user needs to do is click the play button and they will be prompted to choose a template/topic for what they would like their mad-lib to be about. After the template is clicked, boxes will appear for the user to fill out according to the type of word each box prompts him/her to use. Once all the boxes are filled out, all thats left is to click the submit button and a story will appear which consists of all the words the user input into the boxes. If one mad-lib wasn't enough, theres a play again button located underneath the story. The user can play as many times as they'd like for countless hours of hilarity and fun!!!
